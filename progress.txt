I need to make a component that will fetch some record details by its record id. -> done
Now, I created the invoice lwc, now need to validate the inputs(!Not Done)
Then, I need to create an invoice inside the system.

To-do: --> I need to style the child component, and need to validate the invoice object fields before inserting into system,
The LWc is now can create the invoice, 
Need to see the userInput state
 (See: "StockPriceCard Lwc")

 Data Flow: 
 Component loads -> get all related contacts(Child Component)
     |
     V
      -> user input a searchterm ->
      |
      v
       -> if-found->show results (child Component) -> dispatch custom event to parent component -> event contains the contactId
       |
       V 
        -> User Filled the form (Parent Component) -> Checks userInput -> if all okay -> Create the record(Invoice__c)
        |
        V
        If the invoice is saved Successfully ?:Yes: No -> handle the case (Show notification!)

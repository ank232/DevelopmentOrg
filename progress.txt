/*********************************************************************************************************************************************/
Need to create a LWC that will show all invoices(number) by status for a company
|
 -> to update the rollup field 
   |
    -> use triggers(considering all cases)

*************/\**/\****/\***/\*****/\*****/\****/\**/\***********

Apex Triggers: 
-> Prevent Deletion of Invoice if it's in Draft Mode (Invoice Object)
-> Need to show open, overdue and paid invoices(amount[Rollup Field])
-> max 5 invoices can be created at a time
-> develop batch apex to delete last 1 year invoices
-> User cannot add line items if an invoice is already paid
-> User cannot edit any invoice if the invoice status is Pending

Parent LWC ==> createInvoiceFromAccount (GrandParent)

Also ,

    ----------------------------->>>> New Update <<<<---------------------------------
    
    1. Create Invoice From Account LWC :
        |
        V-------------> 
                      |-> Need to remove these Fields: -> Status | Paid Date |  CompanyName
                      |->  Need to add these Fields: -> From Address        

CreateInvoiceLineItem LWC: -> Can be created from two places
                            1. Account Record Page (child Component)
                            2. Invoice Detail Page (Parent Component) 
Account Record Page Data Flow form CreateInvoiceLineItem LWC ===> First we should check if the invoice is created or not -> field validation(lineItem LWC)-> Db insert
Invoice Detail Page Data flow from CreateInvoiceLineItem LWC --=> We should only check for the field validation->field validation(lineItem LWC)-> dbInsert
                                                               ^
                                                               |
Also ---====-> Change the behaviour of component accordingly--- 
                           |
                           L-> On Invoice Record Page it will be shown as a related list 
                           Functionalities-> 1. user can add line items and can also view the existing line items.
                                             2. saveLine Item should be hidden initially and also along with the table of line-item recs 
                                                           |
That table should show the related line            <=------V 
items and as well can we can also delete them    

Functionality -> 1. Showing the related Invoice Line Items -> all fields are showing except Prouduct Name 
Product Search LWC -> Sending the product name and Id (selected product)
When lineItem is used on recordPage -> ... productsearch should display the product name from related records(Wire Method)
    |
    L-> Instead of Using a child component, should use lightning record edit form !

                                 >>>>>>>>>>>> New Update <<<<<<<<<<
CreateLineItems LWC-> It will  be a table with lightning input field (more flexibility!)
SaveLineItem Button Functionality is working fine but there's a catch => user cannot edit any 
                                                                         existing line item without 
                                                                         adding a line item ?
